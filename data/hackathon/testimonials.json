      "text": "We were fortunate enough to get the GirlScript India Summit '19 scholarship and were very excited to go. Part of it was because it was our first hackathon. The themes had been emailed the day before although we didn't realize this until we were already there. The mentors/judges were really helpful and we even got the chance to present our project in front of a Microsoft representative. Overall it was a great experience(partly because of good food). The next day we got to listen to various speakers who gave us some really good insights. 10/10 would go again"
