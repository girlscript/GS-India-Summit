One of the biggest problems that needs to be tackled is the fact that very often people who need help the most hesitate from asking for it. Our goal here was to create a community of people who are truly able to understand and sympathize with each other.  The main focus was to help establish trust between these people so that they can start sharing their burden. To facilitate this, several activities would be conducted which would help build stronger relationships between the participants."
